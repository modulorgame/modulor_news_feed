# Happy Hollidays!|20/12/2023
Hi!

Just a quick update. 
Thanks to everyone for playing the demo. I've patched some bugs. There is still the memory leak bug. I'm working on it. I'm so sorry, but it's very painful.

Apart from that I'm thinking about the future of the game. So [color=94D2BD]happy hollidays[/color] and I'll be sure to let you know about the games direction.

# Demo 1.0 Release!|15/12/2023
Hi!

So [color=94D2BD]the demo just released.[/color]
I'll keep this one short. not to waste your time.

You can play the [color=94D2BD]1st[/color] dungeon out of [color=94D2BD]3[/color].  All the other stuff included ;) Very epic

[color=94D2BD]Nevertheless[/color] I really think this game needs some fine-tuning. I Would love to create a very nice experience for you, but I came to a point were I can't judge the game by myself.

So... here you are. if you haven't played the demo, [color=94D2BD]go![/color]
if you have and you'd like to help, taking the 3 min survey would mean a lot and it'd be very helpful.

I'll take in all the feedback. Patch the bugs and think about the game and my life direction over the holidays.

I'll simplify and reduce all the unnecessary features to create a small but, very fine and deep experience for you.

...or at least i hope :D

and just to be clear. I'm planning on updating this demo with all the changes. not Gatekeeping them for the final game.

[right]I Wish you all the best and happy holidays
